# Mob-programming & the one-pager project

![plot](./images/screenshot.png)

## Overview

The task was to create a business one-pager website that contains an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. It was made in a group of 5 people, using mob-programming technique. This simple project was to be finished during just a couple of hours, durng the intro day of the Web Development Bootcamp (Technigo).

## Business one-pager website

Our group decided to develop a page dedicated to adoption of dogs. We made a simple form where people interested in adoption can fill in their personal information. We also added an accordion using Javascript logic. This is a FAQ section which covers some dogs adoption questions. 
This JavaScript code snippet enhances user interactivity by allowing the toggling of a class, "active," on two specified HTML elements (#section1 and #section2). The code defines toggle functions for each element, and these functions are triggered by click events on the corresponding elements. This implementation provides a straightforward way to toggle visual styles, contributing to a more dynamic and engaging user experience.

## The problem

After the intro days, I decided to add some improvements to our simole project. Instead of an image in the header, I added a video from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/videos/" target="a_blank"> Pexels </a>.
